    <p>My journey starts with Amazon. You know the one. When I got my first promotion within the company I thought, "This is it. This is what my career will be". And set out with the very intention. Then, I hit a wall. I was stuck. So I decided to take advantage of a program Amazon offers, Career Choice. Tuition paid. Classes online. It was perfect. That's how I ended up here, making websites.</p>
    <p>I was learning HTML (I toyed around with already while working at Amazon when I redesigned our departments Wiki page) but also delving into many things I had never touched before like CSS. Now I develop for the community. My goal is to help those just getting their small busniess started. Those that need a boost.
